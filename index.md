I am a post doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi">Prof. Soroush Vosoughi</a>. Broadly my research interests lie in applied machine learning, with emphasis on building interpretable models from uncertain multimodal/multisource data. I am motivated by challenging problems impacting human development. 

 One of the  mapping poverty using multiple disparate data sources, involving satellite imagery and mobile phone data. A  Inter-American Development Bank on poverty mapping for Haiti.
      
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York in 2019, where I received the unversity-wide Chih Foundation Research and Publication Award for 2019. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I was a Researcher in the <a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov">Computer Science and Mathematics Division</a>, <a href="https://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, Oak Ridge, TN. I have completed my Masters in <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.ucr.edu">University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean's Distinguished Fellowship</a>.

> My work on developing computational tools to generate detailed poverty maps from cellphone records was published in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/E9783">Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</a>.
