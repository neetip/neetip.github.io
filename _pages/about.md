I am a post doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at Dartmouth College under the supervision of <a href="https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi">Prof. Soroush Vosoughi</a>, Department of Computer Science and <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/valentino">Prof. Benjamin Valentino</a>, Department of Government.  I am interested in modeling scenarios characterized by noisy, uncertain and high-dimensional data coming from different sources, sensors, modalities or feature spaces. I am passionate about problems of sustainable human development using knowledge inspired and data-driven computational lens. 

I was recently awarded a <a href="https://irving.dartmouth.edu/research/funding-faculty/funded-projects/mapping-country-wide-energy-access-majority-worldgrant">grant</a> from the Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society, Dartmouth College, for predicting country-wide energy access using novel data sources. 

I completed a <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">consultancy</a> with the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on studying poverty and inequality for Haiti from satellite imagery and mobile phone data. I have also been involved in the <a href="https://datapopalliance.org/transform/opal/">OPAL</a> project with DataPop Alliance and National Statistics Office in Senegal for poverty mapping.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2019, where my Ph.D work received the Chih Foundation Research and Publication Award for 2019. During my Ph.D, I received the National Statistics Prize and 2K monetary prize, Data for Development (D4D), Challenge, NetMob Conference, 2015. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I was a Researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, <a href="https://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, Oak Ridge, TN. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean's Distinguished Fellowship.
