<p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#E8E8E8 ; border: 0px;">
  I am a Mirzayan Science Policy Fellow at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Washington DC and also a visiting scholar at the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I am interested in policy aspects that lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and societal well-being.

I completed two years as a postdoc under the supervision of Prof. Soroush Vosoughi, Department of Computer Science, and Prof. Benjamin Valentino, Department of Government at Dartmouth College. During my postdoc, I was awarded a seed <a href="https://irving.dartmouth.edu/research/funding-faculty/funded-projects/mapping-country-wide-energy-access-majority-world">grant</a> on understanding energy poverty as Principal Investigator from the Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society, Dartmouth College.

I model scenarios characterized by noisy, uncertain, and high-dimensional data coming from heterogeneous sources, with emphasis on learning under uncertainty and quantifying biases. I have developed computational methods to map poverty and inequality (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/E9783">PNAS'17</a>, <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">IADB Working Paper'20</a>), to forecast energy deficits given Sustainable Development Goals, to estimate economic well-being (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498332">ACM TDS'21)</a>, as well as to build secure biometric systems (<a href="assets/docs/ieee_tifs.pdf">IEEE TIFS'16</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157880">IEEE Access'20</a>). 

My doctoral work was awarded the Chih Foundation Research Award in 2019, which is a single award of USD 2.5K given for innovative research for the betterment of society at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, from where I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science. During my Ph.D., I was awarded a grant by the Gates Foundation for mapping multi-dimensional poverty using mobile data in collaboration with the National Statistics Office of Senegal and Sonatel/Orange Labs. I have collaborated with the Overseas Development Institute, London, Datapop Alliance and the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on studying poverty and inequality using satellite imagery and mobile phone data.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and I obtained my Masters in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, where I received the Deanâ€™s Distinguished Fellowship. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering with honors.
