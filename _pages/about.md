I am a post doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at Dartmouth College under the supervision of <a href="https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi">Prof. Soroush Vosoughi</a>, Department of Computer Science and <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/valentino">Prof. Benjamin Valentino</a>, Department of Government.  I am interested in modeling scenarios characterized by noisy, uncertain and high-dimensional data coming from different sources, sensors, modalities or feature spaces. I am passionate about problems of sustainable human development using knowledge inspired and data-driven computational lens. 

I was recently awarded a <a href="https://irving.dartmouth.edu/research/funding-faculty/funded-projects/mapping-country-wide-energy-access-majority-worldgrant">grant</a> as a PI from the Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society, Dartmouth College that targets the important problem of energy deficit in poorer economies (USD 31K for June 20-July 21). 

I collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on studying poverty and inequality for Haiti from satellite imagery and mobile phone data. Details <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">here</a>. 

I also collaborated on <a href="https://datapopalliance.org/transform/opal/">OPAL</a> project with DataPop Alliance and National Statistics Office in Senegal for poverty mapping using mobile phone data.

I completed my Ph.D. under Prof. Venu Govindaraju in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2019, where I received the Chih Foundation Research and Publication Award. In 2015, I received the National Statistics Prize and USD 2K prize for Data for Development (D4D), Challenge, NetMob Conference. This work was then funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for USD 20K for 2015-2016. 

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I was a Researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, <a href="https://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, Oak Ridge, TN. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean's Distinguished Fellowship.
