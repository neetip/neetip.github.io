I am a visiting scholar at the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College, where I, just, finished two years as a postdoc under the supervision of Prof. Soroush Vosoughi, Department of Computer Science, and Prof. Benjamin Valentino, Department of Government. I explore critical dualities that lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impacts. Of special interest to me are the potentials of AI for societal development and addressing sustainability issues, while limiting their tendencies to exacerbate biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, etc. to create equitable and inclusive futures.

I model scenarios characterized by noisy, uncertain, and high-dimensional data coming from heterogeneous sources, with emphasis on reasoning under uncertainty and quantifying biases. I have developed statistical and computational methods to map poverty and inequality (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/E9783">PNAS'17</a>, <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">IADB Working Paper'20</a>), to forecast energy deficits given Sustainable Development Goals, to estimate economic well-being in presence of shocks (such as the pandemic) (<a href="assets/docs/acm_tds.pdf">ACM TDS'21)</a>, as well as to build more secure biometric systems (<a href="assets/docs/ieee_tifs.pdf">IEEE TIFS'16</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157880">IEEE Access'20</a>). I also investigate the existence of biases in data-driven systems, in terms of who they represent and who they miss.

I was awarded a seed grant from the Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society, Dartmouth College for 2020-21 to propose methods that enable frequent evaluations of energy deficit in poorer economies in absence of any official surveys. I have collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on studying poverty and inequality for Haiti from satellite imagery and mobile phone data.

My doctoral work was awarded the Chih Foundation Research Award in 2019, which is a single award of USD 2.5K given for innovative research for the betterment of society at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, from where I completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science. During my Ph.D., I led a project funded by the Gates Foundation for mapping multi-dimensional poverty using mobile data in collaboration with the National Statistics Office of Senegal and Sonatel/Orange Labs. I have also collaborated with the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), London, and Datapop Alliance regarding poverty mapping work.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and I obtained my Masters in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, where I received the Deanâ€™s Distinguished Fellowship. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering with honors.
