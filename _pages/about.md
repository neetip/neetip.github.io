I am a computer scientist with expertise in research and policy aspects related to developing responsible AI technologies (RAI). Currently, I am an Information Scientist at RAND in their Engineering and Applied Sciences Department, where I am leading workstreams in developing, deploying, and operationalizing RAI for challenging contexts in national security. I also work on developing AI models for understanding societal well-being and building an inclusive AI workforce. I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery’s U.S. Tech Policy Committee and contribute to their policy pieces.

Before RAND, I was at the National Science Foundation. I was the 2022-23 AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellow at the NSF’s National AI Research Institutes program and in the leadership team of the ExpandAI program. I was the 2022 Mirzayan Policy Fellow at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, where I contributed to the work of the Committee on National Statistics on aspects of data governance.

I have completed my postdoc from the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where my doctoral work was awarded the Chih Foundation Research Award. Before my Ph.D., I was a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean’s Distinguished Fellowship.
