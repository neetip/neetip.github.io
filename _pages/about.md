I am a post doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at Dartmouth College under the supervision of <a href="https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi">Prof. Soroush Vosoughi</a>, Department of Computer Science and <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/valentino">Prof. Benjamin Valentino</a>, Department of Government.  I am interested in modeling scenarios characterized by noisy, uncertain, and high-dimensional data coming from heterogeneous sources, with emphasis on reasoning under uncertainty and quantifying biases. I am passionate about problems aiding in sustainable human development using knowledge inspired and data-driven computational lens and their effects in guiding policy.

I was recently awarded a <a href="https://irving.dartmouth.edu/research/funding-faculty/funded-projects/mapping-country-wide-energy-access-majority-worldgrant">grant</a> as a PI from the Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society, Dartmouth College that targets the important problem of energy deficit in poorer economies (USD 31K for June 2020 - Sep 2021). 

I collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on studying poverty and inequality for Haiti from satellite imagery and mobile phone data. Details <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">here</a>. 

I completed my Ph.D under Prof. Venu Govindaraju in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in Sept 2019, where I received the Chih Foundation Research Award, which is a single award of USD 2.5K given each year for doctoral research related to innovation for the betterment of society. My doctoral thesis is titled, "Learning from Disparate Data: Applications in Biometrics and Sustainability". A part of my doctoral research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for USD 20K for 2015-16, whose research output was published as, "Combining disparate data sources for improved poverty prediction and mapping in PNAS'17 (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/E9783">here</a>).

Prior to joining Ph.D, I was a researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, <a href="https://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, Oak Ridge, TN. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean's Distinguished Fellowship.
