I am a computer scientist with an interest in policy issues related to developing responsible artificial intelligence and data science technologies. I am the 2022-23 AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellow at the National Science Foundation’s National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institutes program, which focuses on long-term fundamental and use-inspired AI research towards issues of national importance. As a fellow, I focus on understanding the AI strategies and policies across the federal space and participating in multi-institution and inter-agency efforts in expanding AI infrastructure and access to underserved communities.

I was the 2022 Mirzayan Policy Fellow at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, where I contributed to the Committee on National Statistics on aspects of data, privacy, and equity. 
  
I completed my postdoc from the Department of Computer Science, at Dartmouth. As a postdoc, I was awarded a seed grant from the Irving Institute for Energy and Society at Dartmouth to develop computational methods for understanding energy accessibility in developing economies. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where my doctoral work was awarded the Chih Foundation Research Award. Before my Ph.D., I was a researcher in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, where I received the Dean’s Distinguished Fellowship. 

My research background is building interpretable machine learning models that model scenarios where data comes from heterogeneous sources, emphasizing quantifying uncertainty and understanding biases. I have developed computational methods to map poverty and inequality (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/E9783">PNAS'17</a>, <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/estimating-and-forecasting-income-poverty-and-inequality-in-haiti-using-satellite-imagery-and-mobile-phone-data">IADB Working Paper'20</a>), to forecast energy deficits given Sustainable Development Goals (<a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00371-5">EPJ-Data Science'22</a>), to estimate economic well-being (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498332">ACM TDS'21)</a>, as well as to build secure biometric systems (<a href="assets/docs/ieee_tifs.pdf">IEEE TIFS'16</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157880">IEEE Access'20</a>). I have also collaborated with the Overseas Development Institute, London, Datapop Alliance, and the Inter-American Development Bank, DC on using novel data and newer methods for human development.
